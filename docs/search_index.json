[["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Main motivation for developing {bigstatsr} and {bigsnpr}", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Main motivation for developing {bigstatsr} and {bigsnpr} The main motivation was for me to be able to run all my analyses within . I was frustrated by having to use all these different software, with different input formats, and requiring text files for parameters. This made it hard for me to build a chain of analyses, to perform some exploratory analyses, or to use familiar packages. Also, I wanted to develop new methods, which seemed very hard to do without using a simple matrix-like format. Thus I started developing package {bigsnpr} at the beginning of my thesis. At some point, I realized that many functions (to perform e.g. GWAS, PCA, summary statistics) were not really specific to genotype data. Indeed, a TWAS or an EWAS are not conceptually very different from a GWAS; one can also perform PCA on e.g. DNA methylation data. Therefore I decided to move all these functions that could be used on any data stored as a matrix and build a new package, {bigstatsr}. This is why there are two packages, where {bigstatsr} can basically be used for any field using matrices, while {bigsnpr} provides some tools rather specific to genotype data, largely building on top of {bigstatsr}. To know which function belongs to which package: functions starting with big_ belongs to {bigstatsr} while functions starting with snp_ or bed_ belongs to {bigsnpr}. A friendly reminder:The correct spelling is - bigstatsr  not bigstatr / BIGstatsR - bigsnpr  not BIGsnpR / bigSNPr - pcadapt  not PCAdapt - LDpred  not LDPredThank youThe kittens thank you too pic.twitter.com/S8wyE4G6BG  Florian Priv√© (remote postdoc) ((privefl?))
