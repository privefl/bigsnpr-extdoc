I was frustrated by having to use all these different software, with different input formats, and requiring text files for parameters. This made it hard for me to build a chain of analyses, to perform some exploratory analyses, or to use familiar packages. Also, I wanted to develop new methods, which seemed very hard to do without using a simple matrix-like format. Thus I started developing package {bigsnpr} at the beginning of my thesis. At some point, I realized that many functions (to perform e.g. GWAS, PCA, summary statistics) were not really specific to genotype data. Indeed, a TWAS or an EWAS are not conceptually very different from a GWAS; one can also perform PCA on e.g. DNA methylation data. Therefore I decided to move all these functions that could be used on any data stored as a matrix and build a new package, {bigstatsr}. This is why there are two packages, where {bigstatsr} can basically be used by any field using matrices, while {bigsnpr} provides some tools rather specific to genotype data, largely building on top of {bigstatsr}. To know which function belongs to which package: functions starting with big_ belongs to {bigstatsr} while functions starting with snp_ or bed_ belongs to {bigsnpr}. A friendly reminder:The correct spelling is - bigstatsr  not bigstatr / BIGstatsR - bigsnpr  not BIGsnpR / bigSNPr - pcadapt  not PCAdapt - LDpred  not LDPredThank youThe kittens thank you too pic.twitter.com/S8wyE4G6BG  Florian Privé (remote postdoc) ((privefl?)) November 18, 2020 1.2 Installation Both packages are available on CRAN, so you can use install.packages(): install.packages(&quot;bigstatsr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;bigsnpr&quot;) To install the latest versions (from GitHub), you can use {remotes}: # install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;privefl/bigstatsr&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;privefl/bigsnpr&quot;) As an alternative to {remotes}, you can also try {pak}, which gives more information and solve other issues.
