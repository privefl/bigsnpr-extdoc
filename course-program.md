## Statistical analyses of large SNP data using R packages bigsnpr and bigstatsr

- Introduction to the packages and to the format used to store large genetic data
- Preprocessing
- Population structure and ancestry inference
- GWAS
- Polygenic scores
- Inference of genetic architecture
- Miscellaneous (if time allows for it)

What will *NOT* be discussed:

- Rare variant association
- Mendelian randomization

TODO:
- time it
- bring hex stickers
- bring USB key with large data
- add small exercises to see if they follow (in exo box) -> should be very fast
- record it (with Zoom I guess)
